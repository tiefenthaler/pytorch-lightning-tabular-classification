# ml_packaging_classification
This repo is meant as a showcase for multi-class classification. It focuses on the following aspects:
- Build a simple ETL pipeline to prepare the data for classification
- Conduct data analysis to get an understandig how to handle the data for multi-class classification
- Builde multiple machine learning pipelines to evaluate best classification performance. The following aspects are considered within those pipelines:
  - Different models (Naive, DecisionTree, RandomForest, LightGBM, XGBoost, Neural Networks)
  - Model hyper-parameter optimization
  - Class imbalance
  - Threshold analysis for probabilistic models
  - Business decision optimization (consideration of class value from a business perspective) for best model
- ...
